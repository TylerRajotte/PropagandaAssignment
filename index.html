        To first start off I had to get a translation for what is being said and is this is what I got. The book reads “5-year plan”, the guy is saying “fantasy, nonsense, utopia” and the red banner reads “Industrialization, collectivization of farms.” To begin one of the major viewpoints that are being presented is a pro-communism one created by them to say that the five-year plan can be achieved. Now for a little bit on the five-year plan, it was a plan to rapidly grow the economy of Russia during the time if the great depression. Many thought that it was going to be virtually impossible just the guy is saying in the poster but they pulled through and pulled it off despite also going through a great famine in those years at the same time. And the poster suggests that one of the aspects that helped them pull off their plan was the Industrialization and collectivization of farms. The intended audience was the general people of Russia but more specifically the farms that fought hard not have the collectivization of farms. But as they experienced successes a great shift of the public opinions also changed. Some of the techniques used are Bandwagoning, Card stacking, and a bit of Demonizing. The biggest I think is bandwagoning especially the sense of being on the right side when it comes to card stacking its also there as well ignoring any possible arguments that the other side would have. And demonizing just due to how the “Naysayer” is drawn.

        This little bit of propaganda is one of the most interesting that I have seen. The basic idea was that the allies were going to sneak anti-german propaganda right under Germanies nose and have it spread within Germany itself. So the way they went about doing this was to put the propaganda into postage stamps that looked very similar to the ones used but still contained there message that they wanted to get across. They changed two things about the stamp in their design. They changed the text from “German Empire” to “Ruined  Empire” and replaced part of Hitler's face to a skeleton version. They way they went about distributing was that they dropped fake letters addressed to real German addresses near recently bombed mail truck. So that when the cleanup team came along the fake letters were added into the rest of the mail. The purpose was to create an opposite voice to the rest of Germany at the time and to mostly poke at Germany at the same time. This whole operation, that's called Cornflakes for some reason, was mostly aimed at the German citizens the type with families and homes that may not be a solid 100% on board with Hitler. The only technique that is being used here is demonization because they turned Hitler into a skeleton. Other than that they use some provoking words but with such a small space they weren’t able to fit much on while still looking like a regular German stamp to those not paying attention.

        This propaganda mostly revolves all around the idea of saving your extra scraps for the war effort to help the United States win the war. But being a whole animated cartoon it goes beyond that and includes several pieces of propaganda within its 8 minutes of runtime. It starts out with the message of saving your scrap and the whole main story revolves around that but within the story they make Daffy Duck overly patriotic, transition from a horses back end to Hitler, make fun of the appearance of the leader the US was facing at the time, then having the mirror break once they are reflected. They also make Hitler talking sound like a dog at times and making the US army seem invincible just to cover half of the smaller things. The cartoon was created by Warner Brothers to help the war effort and was intended for the general population but due to its format of being a cartoon, it makes it more kid-friendly and easier for a younger population to understand. As for techniques used it uses just about all of them. To start it uses glitter generalities near the end and at some other times to reinforce that the US is doing the right thing. It also uses name calling with its dogification of Hitler, making the opposites main weapon a goat and making the Nazi soldiers seem incompetent. Stereotyping is also played up but with any cartoon that's to be expected. Overall some other might be used but they are used to a fairly small effect.

        To begin the caption says "Young builders of communism, go forth toward the new heights in education and labour." This poster can best be summed up as a “Spirit lifter” mostly just because that it's not really pushing much other than communism. It creates a tie between communism and achieving new heights but the main idea is to go out and do your best whether it being labor work or work in a science lab. This was clearly created by the Russian government at the time and is aimed at the young new generation. With every new generation, they usually think that there doing things better than the ones prior, so for the Russian government to add communism into that they were that communism would be considered something great and something overall great. The only big technic that being used is flag waving in the sense that there essentially saying “Go make your country proud, you can do it.”

        This poster reads, “Remeber Oran!” and it depicts a French soldier drowing in the water. This poster as a whole was the response of at the time recent events where the British navy had a conflict with the French navy. To preface this at this time France was under control of Germany but hadn’t been for long. Britain did not like the idea of the French navy being used against them so they launched  “Operation Catapult” where they would persuade the commander of the French naval base at Oran to make sure that the Germans would not get there hands on the naval forces there. The commander didn’t comply and so the British did the next thing they saw fit and destroyed the ships and they sank two battleships and one cruiser and in the process killed 1250 French sailors. This lead to the creation of this propaganda by the French government to really make sure that every French citizen was made well aware of what happened in Oran. The techniques used can be summed up as all the common ones, flag-waving because there is an actual flag being waved. They also use emotions to reinforce their statement with the depiction of the French soldier

        When it comes to Japanese as a whole it very hard to find information but using google translate and a bunch of sources this is what I able to piece together. These piece of propaganda of only one of hundreds that were run from roughly 1938 to 1945 and these were magazines on this particular magazine it roughly reads in the subtext, “Look how smart and capable we are.” In the top left-hand corner, there is the logo of the magazine. The viewpoint presented puts major emphasis on the Japanese military and how that there not the country of sword-wielding samurais they once were and instead of a fully fledged modern military with an advanced navy that can rival the greats such as Britain. When it comes to the creator there isn’t anything clear but its either the government as some of the pages advertise some of the other government projects at the time or its a company that is aligned with the government. The intended audience is basically everyone although with the particular issue that I found there might be a bigger emphasis towards possible Japanese recruits with there glorifying of the military. There a bit of bandwagoning going on here where there almost presenting this as an opportunity but its mostly flag waving as it uses 90% sheer patriotism to appeal and to make its message.
